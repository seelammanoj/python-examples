The first line in this file is the "shebang" line.  When you execute a file 
from the shell, the shell tries to run the file using the command specified 
on the shebang line.  The ! is called the "bang".  The # is not called the
"she", so sometimes the "shebang" line is also called the "hashbang".
The hash character is used because it defines a comment in most scripting
languages, so the shebang line will be ignored by the scripting language
by default.
The shebang line was invented because scripts are not compiled, so they are
not executable files, but people still want to "run" them.  The shebang
line specifies exactly how to run a script.  In other words, this shebang
line says that, when I type in ./basics.py, the shell will actuall run 
  /usr/bin/env python basics.py
We use 
  #!/usr/bin/env python
instead of 
  #!/usr/bin/python
because we must specify an absolute path to a program, and /usr/bin/env 
is a utility that uses the user's path to run an application (in this
case, python).  Thus, it's more portable.

More on shebang lines, including portability: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)

In order to execute a python script without explicitly running python,
you need to add execute permissions to the file.  To do add execute permission
to basics.py, use
  chmod u+x basics.py

Beware that, while I have programmed in python, I am by no means an expert.

"""
def basics(): defines the function \"basics\".  
Note the colon.  A colon is used before any time when you would indent (loop, 
if, function).  
Whitespace is significant, so you must indent.  Also, mixing tabs and spaces 
is a bad idea.  
If you want to paste your code into a python interpreter to test, the 
interpreter will think that you are done with a code block if you ever have a 
blank line (even though it will be fine when you're writing a script), so keep
that in mind before adding extra whitespace

for loops use colons and have whitespace also.  If you're used to programming
in c or java, you might not be used to the foreach loop.  In python, every for
loop is a foreach loop.  That means that you say
  for element in collection:
and "element" will assume every value in the collection.  So, if you have an 
array with the elements in the range between 0 and 9, then you will execute
the loop once with element as every value between 0 and 9, inclusive. Thus,
  for i in range(10):
    print i
will emulate the following c++ code:
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { 
    printf("%d\\n", i);
  }
while loops are as expected
"""
#print("This is for loop")
#for i in range(10):
#  print(i)
#
#  print("now as a while loop!")
#  i = 0
#  while (i < 10):
#    print(str(i) + ' ' ,) #a comma here means that print won't add a newline
#    i += 1 #note: there's no i++ in python.  You have to use += 1.  Sorry.
"""variables are dynamically typed.  So,
  foo = 0
will assign foo to be 0.  
  foo = "hello, world"
will assign foo to be the string "hello, world".
  foo = [1, 2]
will assign foo to be an array with the values 1 and 2
  foo.append(1)
will change foo to [1, 2, 1]
  foo[0] = 9
will change foo to [9, 2, 1]
  foo = {'hello':'world', 1:'dynamic', 2:3}
will assign foo to be a dictionary (a map) from 'hello' to 'world', the 
integer 1 to the string 'dynamic', and the integer 2 to the integer 3.  
  foo['foo'] = 'bar'
will then assign a new mapping from 'foo' to 'bar' in foo.
  foo = set()
will make foo a set
  foo.add('bar') 
will make foo a set containing 'bar'

All data in python are objects.  Python also knows how to print out its
built in objects out of the box.  So, if you try to print an array or 
you're at a python interactive shell and type out the array, it will print.
Python passes referneces to objects by value (the same as java).  
This can seem confusing or unintuitive because some objects are mutable
whereas others are immutable.  Strings, numbers, and tuples (a tuple is
like a low-powered array) are immutable, which means that they're as good
as passed by value.
